# org-link-type-vmrc
Support VMRC links in Emacs Org Mode on Mac OS X.

In Emacs Org Mode, a link looks like: [[Example Link][vmrc:vmrc://@hostname:port/?moid=moid_number]] (notice how the string "vmrc:" is repeated twice), configure VMRC to automatically log in, and configure your VMware hypervisor with a trusted TLS certificate for a more seamless experience.
